```
That new jacket costs $120. Or is it 6 hours of your life?

Vantag converts every expense into the work hours it actually cost you. Not abstract numbers on a screen — real time from your real paycheck. Once you see spending this way, you can't unsee it.

ENTER. SEE. DECIDE.
1. Set your income and work hours
2. Add an expense (type it, say it, or scan a receipt)
3. Instantly see the cost in work hours
4. Choose: Bought it / Still thinking / Passed

Every "Passed" is money redirected to what you actually want.

WORK HOURS CALCULATOR
$50 dinner = 2.5 hours. $1,200 phone = 6 full work days. Numbers that hit different when they're measured in your time, not just your wallet.

AI FINANCE ASSISTANT
"Where did most of my money go this week?" Ask anything. Get instant AI-powered breakdowns of your spending patterns, trends, and blind spots.

SAVINGS GOALS (PURSUITS)
Want a vacation? A new car? An emergency fund? Set a goal, track your progress, and watch every smart decision bring you closer. Passed on takeout? That goes straight to your dream fund.

DECISION TRACKER
Bought it. Thinking about it. Passed. Track every spending decision — not just what you spent, but what you chose not to. See how your decision quality improves over time.

57 ACHIEVEMENT BADGES
Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum tiers. Unlock badges for streaks, savings milestones, smart decisions, and financial discipline. Gamification that actually makes you richer.

VOICE INPUT & RECEIPT SCANNING
Say "Spent $14 on lunch" and it's logged. Or point your camera at a receipt. Two seconds, done.

SUBSCRIPTION TRACKER
Netflix, Spotify, gym, cloud storage — all in one view. See the total monthly cost in work hours. Get alerts before renewals so you never pay for something you forgot.

DETAILED REPORTS
Weekly and monthly breakdowns. Category analysis. Spending trends over time. Beautiful charts that show exactly where your money — and time — went.

DAILY STREAKS
Build a tracking habit. Your streak grows every day you log an expense. The longer the streak, the sharper your financial awareness becomes.

When you realize a $200 impulse buy costs a full work day, decisions get easier. No complicated budgets. No shame. Just perspective that sticks.

Your data is yours. No ads. No tracking. No selling your financial information.

Download Vantag and start seeing what your money really costs.
