How many hours do you work for a $5 coffee? How many days for a new iPhone?

Vantag shows you the real cost of every purchase — in work hours. Connect your income and working hours, then see exactly how long you work for each expense. It's the simplest way to build smarter spending habits.

HOW IT WORKS
1. Enter your income and work schedule
2. Add an expense (or speak it — voice input supported)
3. See how many work hours it costs
4. Decide: "Bought it", "Thinking", or "Passed"

CORE FEATURES

Work Hours Calculator
Instantly see how many hours you work for any expense. $50 lunch = 2.5 hours of your life. Real numbers, real perspective.

AI Finance Assistant
Ask questions like "Where did I spend the most this month?" and get AI-powered insights about your spending patterns.

Savings Goals (Pursuits)
Set goals for things you want — vacation, new phone, emergency fund. Every expense you pass on automatically adds to your savings progress.

Subscription Tracker
Track Netflix, Spotify, gym memberships, and more in one place. Get reminders before renewals so you never pay for something you forgot about.

Voice Input
Just say "Spent $12 on lunch" and it's recorded. Fast, hands-free expense tracking.

Detailed Reports
Monthly breakdowns, category analysis, spending trends — all visualized with clean charts. See exactly where your money goes.

Streak System
Build a daily tracking streak. The longer your streak, the more mindful you become about spending.

Multi-Currency Support
Switch between USD, EUR, GBP, TRY, and SAR. Perfect for travelers or anyone managing finances in multiple currencies.

BNPL & Installment Tracking
Track buy-now-pay-later purchases and installment plans. See the true total cost including time value.

Smart Notifications
Get thoughtful reminders about your spending patterns — not spam, just awareness when it matters.

WHY VANTAG?
Most budget apps show you numbers. Vantag shows you TIME. When you see that a $200 purchase costs 10 hours of your life, you naturally make better decisions. No guilt trips, no complicated budgets — just perspective.

Privacy-first: Your financial data stays on your device. No ads, no data selling.

Download Vantag and start seeing the real cost of your purchases.
